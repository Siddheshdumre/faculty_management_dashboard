## Project Overview
The Faculty Management Dashboard is a web-based application built to handle a wide range of faculty information, including personal details, departmental affiliations, and scheduling data. This application is intended to reduce the workload on administrative teams by centralizing and simplifying the management of faculty profiles. With features such as user roles and department-based faculty assignments, this dashboard serves as a central hub for faculty data management within educational institutions.

## Features

- **Department Management**: Faculty can be assigned to specific departments, enabling easy access to department-based data and organizational hierarchy.
- **Scheduling**: Streamlined faculty scheduling functionality, allowing admins to assign and update availability and class schedules.
- **User Role Management**: Secure role-based access with different permissions for Admins and regular Users, ensuring data privacy and control.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and tables provide an overview of faculty distribution and other metrics.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
